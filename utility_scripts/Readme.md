## When to Use these Scripts
These scripts are primarily meant for running the application as a service on a server. 

They are simple scripts that can be memorized, but are useful when getting the hang of this project. The situation to use each one is guided by their name (i.e. `start_service` starts the service)

## Precondition
1. You **MUST** have run `install/setup_service.sh` at somepoint. If you download a newer version of this project, rerun the script before starting the service.
2. The script **MUST** be run with sudo - the permissions are necessary to start the process
